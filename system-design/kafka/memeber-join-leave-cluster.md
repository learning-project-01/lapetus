When a new broker joins or leaves a Kafka cluster, Kafka performs several operations to ensure the health, consistency, and availability of data across the cluster. These events trigger **partition rebalancing**, which affects how Kafka distributes and replicates the partitions across brokers.

### **When a New Broker Joins a Kafka Cluster**

1. **Rebalancing Partitions**:
   - Kafka will **rebalance the partitions** to take advantage of the additional broker. This involves redistributing existing partitions across brokers to ensure an even load distribution. Kafka uses the **partition reassignment** mechanism for this.
   
2. **Partition Reassignment**:
   - When a new broker joins, the partitions from existing brokers are moved or reassigned to the new broker. This helps balance the load and makes use of the added broker's resources.
   - Each partition is replicated according to its replication factor, so when partitions are reassigned, the replication factor is maintained by ensuring that the new broker becomes one of the replica brokers (if the replication factor allows it).
   
3. **Leader Election (If Necessary)**:
   - If any partition is reassigned to the new broker, Kafka might perform **leader election** for some partitions. A leader is selected among the in-sync replicas (ISR), and it may be moved to the new broker.
   - If the partition's leader was previously located on another broker, the leader can be moved to the new broker if it is in sync with the other replicas.
   
4. **Updating the Kafka Metadata**:
   - Once the new broker joins and the partitions have been reassigned, the Kafka cluster updates its **metadata** to reflect the new broker's presence and the changes to partition assignments.
   - Consumers, producers, and controllers in the cluster will also update their metadata to reflect the new broker.

5. **Impact on Availability**:
   - If properly configured (e.g., with `min.insync.replicas`), the partition reassignment and leader election will not affect the availability of the Kafka cluster. Kafka will ensure that the partition leaders are selected from in-sync replicas (ISR), ensuring durability and availability.
   
6. **Load Balancing**:
   - The addition of a new broker helps Kafka distribute partition replicas more evenly across brokers, which can help in scaling the system and managing load efficiently.

### **When a Broker Leaves the Kafka Cluster**

1. **Rebalancing Partitions**:
   - When a broker leaves the Kafka cluster (either by crashing or being intentionally shut down), Kafka performs **partition rebalancing** again to redistribute the partition replicas of the departing broker to other brokers in the cluster.
   
2. **Leader Re-Election**:
   - If the broker that leaves was the **leader** of any partitions, Kafka will automatically trigger a **leader election** for those partitions. The leader will be reassigned to one of the in-sync replicas (ISR).
   - If there are no in-sync replicas, the partition will become **under-replicated** until a replica catches up.
   
3. **Replica Distribution**:
   - Kafka will move the **replicas** of the partitions from the departing broker to other brokers in the cluster to ensure that the replication factor is met for each partition.
   - In the absence of available brokers to take over the replicas, Kafka may fall back to maintaining an under-replicated partition. This could potentially lead to a **loss of data availability** for the affected partition until the situation is resolved.

4. **Metadata Update**:
   - Kafka will update its metadata and notify the **Zookeeper** or **KRaft (Kafka Raft)** consensus layer of the changes. The cluster's metadata, as well as the consumers and producers, will be updated to reflect the absence of the broker and the new partition assignments.

5. **Impact on Availability**:
   - During the broker departure, there may be some temporary **reduced availability** for affected partitions, especially if the cluster is already under heavy load or if there are no in-sync replicas available.
   - If the replication factor is high enough and other brokers have in-sync replicas, the cluster can continue operating with minimal disruption.

6. **Under-replicated Partitions**:
   - If there are fewer than `min.insync.replicas` replicas (the number of replicas required to be in sync to acknowledge writes), Kafka will mark those partitions as **under-replicated**. This means that some partitions might temporarily be unavailable for writes until replication is restored.

### **Key Concepts and Parameters Involved**

1. **Replication Factor**: 
   - The number of replicas for each partition. A higher replication factor improves availability and fault tolerance.

2. **Leader Election**:
   - The process of choosing the leader replica for a partition. The leader handles all read and write requests for the partition.

3. **In-Sync Replicas (ISR)**:
   - These are the replicas that are fully caught up with the leader and can be elected as the leader in case of failure.

4. **min.insync.replicas**:
   - This is a Kafka configuration that ensures a minimum number of replicas must acknowledge a write for it to be considered successful. This helps prevent data loss in the event of broker failures.

5. **Partition Reassignment**:
   - Kafka's mechanism for redistributing partitions among brokers to balance the load.

6. **Zookeeper or KRaft (Kafka Raft)**:
   - In traditional Kafka, **Zookeeper** manages metadata and broker coordination. In **KRaft mode**, Kafka uses its own consensus protocol (Raft) for broker management and metadata.

### **Impact of Broker Joining and Leaving on Kafka Cluster**

1. **When a New Broker Joins**:
   - **Increased availability and fault tolerance**.
   - **Improved load distribution** as partitions are redistributed across the brokers.
   - **Potential leader election** if partitions are reassigned to the new broker.

2. **When a Broker Leaves**:
   - **Temporary data unavailability** or **under-replicated partitions** if no in-sync replicas are available.
   - **Leader re-election** for partitions that were led by the departed broker.
   - **Rebalancing and replication** to restore data availability.

### **Best Practices**

1. **Use a Sufficient Replication Factor**:
   - Ensure that each partition has a replication factor of at least 3 to handle broker failures gracefully.

2. **Monitor Partition and Replica Distribution**:
   - Use monitoring tools like **Kafka Manager** or **Confluent Control Center** to monitor the distribution of partitions and replicas, ensuring that partitions are well-distributed across brokers.

3. **Ensure `min.insync.replicas` is Properly Configured**:
   - Set `min.insync.replicas` appropriately to ensure that there are enough in-sync replicas to maintain durability and availability in case of broker failure.

4. **Graceful Broker Shutdown**:
   - When shutting down a broker, make sure to perform a **graceful shutdown** to allow Kafka to move the leader and replicas to other brokers, avoiding unnecessary data loss or downtime.

### **Conclusion**

When a new broker joins or leaves a Kafka cluster, the system performs **partition rebalancing**, **leader elections**, and updates **metadata** to ensure that data is consistently replicated and distributed across brokers. The cluster's fault tolerance, availability, and data durability are maintained, though there may be temporary impacts during the rebalancing process, especially in scenarios where brokers leave unexpectedly. Proper configuration of replication factors and availability settings ensures minimal disruption during these events.
